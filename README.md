# Global Routing Problem Generator
Benchmark Generator for Global Routing
This repository functions as an automatic benchmark generator for global routing problems. Benchmarks are solved with Tree&A*Search algorithm.
Heatmaps representing traffic on edges of different directions (horizontal, vertical,via) are given as below.   
### Images showing edge traffic in 300-by-300 benchmarks.
